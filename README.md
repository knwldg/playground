# Python3 Playground

A place to keep my attempts at self-learning DS/Algo concepts, as well as personal solutions for some Leetcode problems, solved in Python.

I don't claim these to be the best in any way, these are my attempts to solve these in the most maintainable and performant fashion. Some problems have more than one solution, in case there's a big difference between the most maintainable and readable solution, and the most performant one.
I include a small helper function in order to time the different solutions, which I use in some cases.

It could definitely be better structured, but hey, nobody said this was production quality :D
